# Full Stack Healthcare Value of Care Analysis Project
By: _**Nadia Richards, Samori Emmanuel, Noah Goldstein, Perry Reynolds**_

## Background
---
In the wake of a global pandemic, public health and healthcare have risen to the forefront of the public eye. Questions have been raised and scenarios proposed about our current healthcare system and the flaws withtin. We took an extensive look at the various care models across the country and how they compare in terms of price paid per condition type, as well as how the price of certain conditions vary across the country. By focusing specifically on Heart Failure, Pneumonia, Hip/Knee Replacements, and Heart Attacks, we were able to take an in depth look at medical data and develop the results detailed below.


## Tools and Technology Used for Analysis
---
* VSCode
* Healthcare Data CSVs
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* QuickDBD
* SQL
* PostgreSQL
* Javascript
* D3
* Plotly
* Leaflet
* MapBox
* CSS
* HTML
* Flask App


## Process Flow
---
1. CSV and API into Pandas
2. Cleanse data
3. Push data to SQL database
4. Create Flask API
5. Pull data into browser using JavaScript
6. Generate Dashboard using D3, MapBox, Plotly, etc.


## Data Sources (1 CMS.gov Dataset, 1 Census.gov Dataset, 1 OpenDataSoft.com Dataset)
---
1. **National Payment and Value of Care Data by Hospital:** see dataset [HERE](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/c7us-v4mf)
2. **Census Data - Zipcodes, Population, Poverty Rate, and Median Income:** see data source [HERE](https://www.census.gov/data/developers.html)
   - We used the following sources to utilize the census data API:
